# Geometry Calculator
oop-assigment-01

Description:

This Java program, "Geometry Calculator," is a simple command-line application that allows the user to calculate the areas of basic geometric shapes: circles, rectangles, and triangles. It provides a menu-based interface for the user to select the shape they want to calculate the area for and then prompts for the required measurements.

Features:

* Calculates the area of a circle given its radius.
* Calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.
* Calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height.
* Offers a "Quit" option to exit the program.
* Supports user interaction via a text-based menu.
  
Usage:

* The user is presented with a menu to select a geometric shape.
* Depending on the selection, the program prompts for the required measurements.
* After inputting the measurements, it calculates and displays the area.
* The user can continue to calculate more areas or choose to quit.
  
Contributing:

This is a basic example, but if you'd like to improve or extend the functionality, you can contribute by enhancing the user interface, adding more geometric shapes, or providing additional features.
